    "- So now I should be able to switch on `WV_NEW_FEEDBF` and `WV_NEW_LES` and still get the correct results.\n",
    "- For `WV_NEW_FEEDBF` this is OK!\n",
    "- For `WV_NEW_LES` this is not possible because `WV_NEW_LES` eliminates the `diu*` arrays used by `velfg`. So as a first step we need to adapt `velfg` to work without `diu*` only, keeping the other arrays. \n",
    "- I did that, removed arrays in `vel2`, as far as I can tell they are not used outside it, so no point in computing bounds on them. And yes, it works, although the result is a little bit different from the result with the arrays. To be sure, I ran a sim for 500 timesteps, and it's fine.\n",
    "- Meanwhile, lets remove `nou*`, as this is not used outside `velfg` so also not outside `vel2` I guess. I did this using `WV_NEW_LES2`. I ran a sim for 500 timesteps, and it's fine.\n",
    "- Finally, let's look at `cov*`, as the problem must be there (or in the inlined boundary calcs? unlikely!).\n",
    "- I do this in two steps: \n",
    " (1) merge the (2-D) boundary calculations into the 3-D loops, using `WV_NEW_VEL2`. This is fine (run of 100)\n",
    " (2) scalarise the loops to ultimately remove `cov*`, and that should be `WV_NEW_VELFG` I guess.\n",
    " I checked the code and found that I had omitted some boundary conditions (k=1) for cov3 and cov6. But it still NaNs, so back to the drawing board.\n",
    "- OK, now it is fixed. Essentially there were errors in the boundary conditions. I've done a sim for 500 timesteps, and it's fine. Now doing an MPI run for 500 steps, then one for 10000 steps.\n",
    "- However, running 10000 steps with MPI NaNs, after less than 1000 steps.\n",
    "- However however, running 10000 steps without MPI does not NaN. Still, the values are not the same as for the MPI run. This is not so surprising as the point where the values are taken is a bit different.\n",
    "- So now I must find out why the MPI version NaNs. \n",
    "    - I can see no reason in velFG itself.\n",
    "    - feedbf(m) seems OK, all we did is localise the `*mask` arrays\n",
    "    - It is possible that the problem is rather `MPI_NEW_WV` as I only ran this for 50 steps.\n",
    "    - No, I checked running with `MPI_NEW_WV` undefined and it still NaNs\n",
    "    - So I must go back and undef the WV_NEW features. Starting with `WV_NEW_VELFG`\n",

    "        - the configuration file `rf4a.cfg` is present.\n",
    "    2. autopar: Auto-parallelise the host code and generate the kernel in F95 syntax. This step requires the definition of macros used in the code, in two ways:\n",
    "        - Macros to be expanded using the C preprocessor. You must define/undef these in the file `macros.h`. The script will warn if this file is not present.\n",
    "        - Macros enclosing code to be skipped by the compiler. This is used  in particular because the compiler can't handle IO operations.\n",
    "        You must define/undef these in the file `macros_to_skip.h`. The script will warn if this file is not present.\n",
    "    3. convert: Convert the kernel to OpenCL. \n",
    "    The OpenCL kernel code uses two macros, the number of threads per compute unit NTH and the number of compute units NUNITS. \n",
    "    These can be defined using the --nth and --nunits flags or in the file `macros_kernel.h`.\n",
    "    4. build: Build the OpenCL Fortran code. The code is built using an auto-generated SConstruct file. \n",
