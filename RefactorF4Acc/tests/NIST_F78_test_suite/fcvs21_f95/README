Fortran
Available Test Suites

The FORTRAN78 test suite is a product of the NIST Information Technology 
Laboratory (ITL). It is used to determine, insofar as is practical, the degree 
to which a FORTRAN processor conforms to FIPS Fortran. 
The Fortran test suite consists of programs containing features of Standard 
Fortran, their related data and an executive program that prepares the audit 
routines for compilation. Each program includes tests and supporting 
procedures indicating the results of the tests. The testing of a processor in 
a particular hardware/operating system environment is accomplished by 
compiling and executing each program.

Acknowledgment:
The present version has been slighly altered in the following way:
- a non standard conforming FORMAT statement has been fixed in FM110.f.
- Hollerith strings in FORMAT statements have been converted to quoted
  strings to conform to the Fortran 95 standard.
- Files FM046.f, FM090.f and FM091.f are variants of FM045.f, FM010.f and FM011.f without spaces in tokens.
