=info
In Fortran-77, if a file with common blocks is included in a subroutine, the common variables are visible in called subroutines, even if these don't include that file.
To determine which common variables are actually used by a subroutine, we perform the following analysis.

`_find_root_for_include()` is called for every include file in IncludeFiles, after `_create_include_chains()` has created all the chains; 
by 'chain' we mean a path in the call tree where every node contains the include for its child nodes.
The purpose of this routine is to prune the paths, i.e. remove includes from nodes that don't need them.
The algorithm is as follows: 
- compare Includes with CommonIncludes.
    - if an inc is only in CommonIncludes, it is inherited
    - the node needs to keep it either
        - it has more than one child node
        - it contains a call to a refactored subroutine which contains the include  
    - any other case, just remove the include
