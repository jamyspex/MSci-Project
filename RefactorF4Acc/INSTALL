The source code for RefactorF4ACC is written in Perl and requires v5.10 or later. There are no dependencies and no compilation is required. 

To install RefactorF4ACC, you need to set some environment variables. Typically, on Linux you would put them in `.bashrc`, on MacOS in `.profile`.

* If you cloned the GitHub repostitory:
	- Let's assume your local Git repository directory is called $RF4A_DIR (e.g. on my machine it is $HOME/Git/RF4A)
* If you downloaded the archive RefactorF4Acc-master.zip:
	- Let's assume you unzip the archive in a directory $DIR (this could be e.g. your home dir $HOME)
	- Let's call $RF4A_DIR=$DIR/RefactorF4Acc-master

* Add $RF4A_DIR to the $PERL5LIB environment variable:

 		export PERL5LIB="$PERL5LIB:$RF4A_DIR"
 		
* Add $RF4A_DIR to your $PATH environment variable:

		export PATH="$PATH:$RF4A_DIR/bin"	  

To make the code work with older Perl versions (e.g. v5.8) you will have to replace all occurences of `say` with `print` and add a newline.
