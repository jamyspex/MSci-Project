# NOTE
# -------
This is the common build file that can be used for multiple platform targets.

It is currently verified with the followign targets:

1. AOCL:	Nallatech's AOCL target on BOLAMA
2. SDACCEL:     Alpha-Data's SDACCEl target on BOLAMA
3. GPU:		Nvidia GPU on KANTON
4. CPU:         Intel Xeon CPU on BOLAMA	

The build file should be run from its current location, but expects certain target folders to be available
for each of the possible targets. 

The script moves to that folder first, and all following actions are taken from there, including creating a 
custom build folder for each build.

BATCH BUILD
-----------
The batch build script should also be called from this folder. The target must be specified in EACH of the
build commands in the batch build description file.


BUILD EXAMPLES:
----------------

 ./build.pl -tar AOCL -w FLOAT -row 50  -col 50  -ntot 1000 -wi SINGLEWI -nut -ch -f cpu_emu
 ./build.pl -tar AOCL -w FLOAT -row 500 -col 500 -ntot 1000 -wi SINGLEWI      -ch -f hw
