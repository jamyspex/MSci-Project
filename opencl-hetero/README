DESCRIPTION:
----------------
1. Opencl implementation of the 2d-shallow water from Kampf text, for heterogenuous targets.
  a) AOCL (Nallatech on BOLAMA)
  b) AOCL_CHREC (Gidel boards on Novo-G# cluster)
  [The following are not yet implemented. Artefacts of code for each of these targets is there, but some work is needed to make code compatible,
  specially on the use of AOCL specific channels]
  c) SDACCEL (Alpha Data on BOLAMA)
  d) GPU (Nvidia on KANTON)
  e) CPU (Intel Xeon on BOLAMA) 

BUILD:
------

The project has a perl based build system. Run the following to look at its help:

> cd ./build
> ./build.pl -h

E.g. usage for HOST-only run, 51x51 (2 added on each side for boundaries), floating points
(remove -nut if you want to create a unique build directory for each run)

> ./build.pl -tar CPU -nut -w FLOAT -d 53
> cd build-host-only/build-current/run.exe


RUN
---:

1. <host_exectuble> <kernel source>

2. If target is NOVOG, then you have to pass a separate kernel file for each device, in the correct sequence 
   (first argumetn for device[0] and so on)

 
Folders
-------

/build
Common build folder for all targets. This will be your starting point 
for all builds

/build-xxx
target specific builds are placed in theor respective folders; 
every build is placed into a unique sub-folder named from time-stamp and 
application parameters

/device
common kernel file for all targets

/host
common host file for all targets. Target specific choices are made by Pre-Processor
