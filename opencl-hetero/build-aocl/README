IBM MACHINE @ CHREC
=====================

I am only mentioning the relvant builds:


./build-AOCL-155.184623-FLOAT1-53-cpu_emu
This is emulator build that produces correct results for an EPSILON of 0.00001.

./build-AOCL-155.184730-FLOAT1-53-hw
Attempt to build 53x53 HW solution. Did not fit.

./build-AOCL-156.142843-FLOAT1-53-hw
Added these optimizations:
CLCC_OPT += -O3
CLCC_OPT += --util 90
CLCC_OPT += --fp-relaxed
CLCC_OPT += --fpc
Still did not fit.

./build-AOCL-156.154211-FLOAT1-32-hw
Reduced size to 32x32, optimizations still there.
Synthesis successful.
Results incorrect for EPSILON of 0.00001 (first result was incorrect)

./build-AOCL-157.113830-FLOAT1-32-hw
Same as previous, with EPSILON changed to 0.1
Still incorrect results encountered (incorrect results appear a bit later).


./build-AOCL-157.13832-FLOAT1-32-hw
Optimizations removed.
*** CORRECT HARDWARE RUN *** (Albeit with EPSILON = 0.01)
32x32, timings also recorded.
Time loop: on the host
An strange observation was that if I do multiple runs in a single execution,
each subsequent run is slower than the previous. (Run this and see).
This is not the case when I take the TIME loop on the device (the RUNS loop
stays on the host either way).



./build-AOCL-157.174328-FLOAT1-32-hw
SINGLEWI KERNEL
Optimizations removed.
*** CORRECT HARDWARE RUN *** (Albeit with EPSILON = 0.01)
32x32, timings also recorded.
Time loop: on the device. 
MUCH faster than time loop on host. Now competing with host on timing, even
with O2


./build-AOCL-163.13322-FLOAT1-53-hw-NDRANGE
NDRANGE KERNEL
*** CORRECT HARDWARE RUN *** (Correct EPISLON)
53x53
Time loop: on the device. 
(Cannot change dimension without complete hardware build as x/y indices
are calculated internally in the kernel)

./build-AOCL-163.16133-FLOAT1-500-hw-NDRANGE
NDRANGE KERNEL
500x500 (fixed size as indices are extracted from compile-time constants)
Time loop: on device
Performs ~2.5x better than HOST-run for NTOT=1000

./build-AOCL-163.19440-FLOAT1-500-hw-NDRANGE-AOCO3
+ -O3 passed to aoc (resource-driven optimization)
All other same as previous


./build-AOCL-187.92246-FLOAT1-500-hw-SINGLEWI-CHANNELS
NDRANGE KERNEL
500x500 (fixed size as indices are extracted from compile-time constants)
Time loop: on device
*** using channels, single device
